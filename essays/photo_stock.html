    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <small><i><p>It's not a tutorial that covers the described topics in an excess way. It is actually small and simple HOWTO that fixates couple of nice but controversial ideas in the area of my subtle Django experiences.</p>	</i></small>
<p>Today I want to show you how to make extremely simple telegram bot using <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">Nginx</a> as SSL-proxy, <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/overview">Django</a> as API framework, and <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start">minikube</a> as local development multinode Kubernetes cluster.</p>
    <p>These tools have clean and complete documentation, so I don't take task to delve into the advanced or complex features. Just a bit of code and comments. Let's go.

    <section>
    <h4>Bootstraping kubernetes</h4>
    <p>Once upon a time I was wandering switching browsing tabs trying to figure out which instant k8s cluster to use for local development.</p>
    <p>For a long and exciting couple of days I was encompassed with vagrant, ansible and kubeadm, and it become obvious that I was loosing the battle. Neither Calico nor flunnel wont connect the nodes the way I wanted. I had a strong feeling that I was on the right way by the moment I begun to comprehend how k8s internal components interacting with each other and how it may be tuned with kube-proxy settings.</p>
    <p>But finally I was drained and didn't get working cluster setup. So I moved on.</p>
    <p>MicroK8s looked promising, but it just didn't work for me. I think I am really grasp and like these nice IoT ideas behind MicroK8s with dqlite and prod-ready battaries, but on my virtualbox vm's it demands some virtual bridge adapters tuning and I decided to find something more canonical.</p>
    <p>The next option and the option on which I decided to stay is minikube. It's vendor recommended and so much easy to use. And I had no problems running it at all.</p>
    <p>Let's create dual-node setup with 2 cores of cpu and 3 gb of memory each:</p>
    <p>
    <pre><code>
minikube start --nodes 2 --cpus=2 --memory=3gb
    </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>That's it! Like a charm. Now you have kubectl configured to work with your cluster. Nice.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h4>Dealing with Django</h4>
    <p>It is time to write some code.</p>
    <pre><code>#app/health/views.py

from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.views import View


class Check(View):
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return JsonResponse({"status": "online"})
    </pre></code>
    <pre><code>#app/app/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from health.views import Check

urlpatterns = [
    path("health/", Check.as_view()),
]
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code>#app/health/tests.py

import json

from django.test import TestCase
from django.test import Client
    
class TestHealthCheck(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
    self.c = Client()
    
    def test_is_service_online_route(self):
    resp = self.c.get("/health/")
    self.assertEquals(json.loads(resp.content), {"status": "online"})
    </code></pre>
    <p>As you can see I created django project named <i>app</i> and project`s application named <i>health</i>. </p>
    <p><i>health</i> app implements api endpoint for deployment healthcheck. It means that k8s will periodically query this endpoint to ensure that django application is still alive and responding well.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h4>Naming first</h4>
    <p>It is time to reveal the project name and some specifications, isn't it? :-)</p>
    <p>Ok. Whole project named PhotoStock and, as you already know, it is yet another telegram bot:
    <ol>
    <li>It gets updates from telegram api by webhook, waiting for photos.</li>
    <li>It saves photos into database.</li>
    <li>It serves received photos as html page.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Now, from the list above, we see, that we've got to write implementation of two apps: the first one, let's name it <i>telegram_bot</i> and the second one, let's name it <i>photos</i>.</p>
    <p>Both will deal with photo data: <i>telegram_bot</i> will receive it from telegram api and save, <i>photos</i> will convert it into formatted form and give it out to client.</p> 
    <p>As we didn't deploy any database server within the cluster, we will use sqlite3 database enabled in Django by default. Hence our application will be <i>stateful</i>.</p>
    <p>But we will kill two birds with one stone and deploy it as <i>stateless</i>. It is simpler, takes less time, and you can learn by example that stateful app deployed as stateless will loose data on restart or update.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h4>Flawing design</h4>
    <p>The central idea and purpose of this proof of concept is to maintain two separate orm models on the top of one source database table.</p>
    <p>Let's look at this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">#app/telegram_bot/models.py

import json
import os
import logging

import django.dispatch
import requests
from django.db import models


logger = logging.getLogger("uploaded_photo")


class UploadedPhoto(models.Model):
    file_name = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=False)
    file_data = models.BinaryField(null=False)
    description = models.TextField(null=False, default="")

    class Meta:
        db_table = "photos"
        managed = False

    on_new_photo = django.dispatch.Signal()

    @staticmethod
    def download_binary(file_id) -> bytes:
        try:
            bot_token = os.environ["BOT_TOKEN"]
            resp = requests.get(
                f"https://api.telegram.org/bot{bot_token}/getFile?file_id={file_id}"
            )
            file_path = json.loads(resp.content).get("result").get("file_path")
            return requests.get(
                f"https://api.telegram.org/file/bot{bot_token}/{file_path}"
            ).content
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(e)
    </code></pre>
    <p><i>telegram_bot</i> has it own secondary data layer with migrations turned off due to conflicts between models with shared source of data.</p>
    <p>This layer can retrieve image data from telegram api. It can save that data into database since the layer is Django ORM model.</p>
    <p>It provides <i>on_new_photo</i> signal outside, so we can be subscribed for this signal from anywhere, e.g. from the sibling model.</p>
    <p>For example, the signal is triggered outside the model in our webhook. It is not a bug, it is a feature. We also attach data with signal beeing sent.</p>
    <p>Next. Primary data model (saying "primary" I mean "with enabled migrations" basically):</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">#app/photos/models.py

import base64
from django.db import models
from telegram_bot.models import UploadedPhoto


class UserPhoto(models.Model):
    file_name = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=False)
    file_data = models.BinaryField(null=False)
    description = models.TextField(null=False, default="")
    base64 = models.TextField(null=True)

    class Meta:
        db_table = "photos"
        managed = True

    @staticmethod
    def convert_base64(sender: UploadedPhoto, **kwargs):
        UserPhoto.objects.filter(file_name=sender.file_name).update(
            base64=base64.b64encode(sender.file_data).decode("UTF-8")
        )


UploadedPhoto.on_new_photo.connect(UserPhoto.convert_base64)
    </code></pre>
    <p><i>photos</i> data model is primary, since it is larger, and has additional (in compare to <i>UploadedPhoto</i>) data fields. To be precise - the only one additional field to store base64-encoded image data.</p>
    <p>Why base64?</p>
    <p>The trick I will use is to have images injected into HTML page as base64 encoded strings to simplify photo serving.</p>
    <p>We don't have isolated frontend service with data representation, so I want to avoid serving static files with Django or putting image data on some external service as nginx folder.</p>
    <p>Webhook:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">#app/telegram_bot/views.py

import json
import logging

from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views import View

from telegram_bot.models import UploadedPhoto

logger = logging.getLogger("web_hook")


class WebHook(View):
    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        try:
            photo = json.loads(request.body).get("message").get("photo")
            match photo:
                case None:
                    pass
                case photo:
                    file_id = photo[0].get("file_id")
                    saved = UploadedPhoto.objects.create(
                        file_name=file_id,
                        file_data=UploadedPhoto.download_binary(file_id),
                    )
                    UploadedPhoto.on_new_photo.send(saved)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(e)
        finally:
            return HttpResponse(status=200)
    </code></pre>
    <p>Here we receive update from telegram api in a form of HTTP POST query. Then we are trying to parse it and, in case of success, to download image file. If the end of routine is reached out without exceptions, <i>on_new_photo</i> signal will be fired up.</p>
    <p>We will always return HTTP status "200 OK" back to Telegram API. 
    <p>This is how we render feed.template with base64-encoded images:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">#app/photos/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.views import View

from photos.models import UserPhoto


class Photos(View):
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        encoded_photos = UserPhoto.objects.filter(base64__isnull=False).values_list(
            "base64"
        )
        return render(
            request,
            "feed.template",
            {"images": [data[0] for data in encoded_photos]},
        )
    </code></pre>
    <p>And the last frontier -- frontend template:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-xml"><xmp><!-- app/photos/templates/feed.template -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Photo Stock</title>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

</head>
<body>
<main>
    {% for encoded_img in images %}
    <article>
        <img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,{{ encoded_img }}">
    </article>
    {% endfor %}
</main>
</body>
</html>
    </xmp></code></pre>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h4>Deploying stuff</h4>
    <p>As application will be deployed to k8s, we have to containerize it. Docker is a default option:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-docker">#Dockerfile

FROM python:3.10-bullseye

LABEL maintainer="fuzz88"

COPY requirements.txt /opt/

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /opt/requirements.txt

COPY app/ /opt/app/
COPY entrypoint.sh /opt/

EXPOSE 8081

CMD ["sh", "/opt/entrypoint.sh"]
    </code></pre>
    <p>It is wrong not to use uvicorn, gunicorn, supervisord, but let's keep entrypoint.sh simple:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">#entrypoint.sh
 
#!/bin/bash
python /opt/app/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8081
    </code></pre>
    <p>Don't forget to tag the image on build:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">#build.sh

#!/bin/bash
sudo docker build -t your_registry/photo_stock:latest .
sudo docker push your_registry/photo_stock:latest
    </code></pre>
    <p>Let's create k8s Secret in order to link it with BOT_TOKEN environment variable in the Pod.</p>
    <p>But before let's describe our Pod:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-yaml">#deployment/pod.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: photo-stock
    labels:  
    app: photo-stock
spec:
    containers:
    - name: photo-stock
        image: "your_registry/photo_stock:latest"
        env:
        - name: BOT_TOKEN
            valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
                name: photo-stock
                key: BOT_TOKEN
                optional: false
    </code></pre>
    <p>Then the Secret:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">
[fuzz@workstation my_k8s]$ kubectl create secret generic photo-stock --from-literal=BOT_TOKEN=123123123:AAEi3fDLxSY
secret/photo-stock created
    </code></pre>
    <p>Next step is to run the Pod:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">
(photo_Stock) [fuzz@workstation photo_stock]$ kubectl apply -f deployment/pod.yaml 
pod/photo-stock created
    </code></pre>
    <p>And expose the HTTP port via Service:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">
[fuzz@workstation my_k8s]$ kubectl expose pod photo-stock --port 8081 --type=NodePort --name photo-stock
service/photo-stock exposed

[fuzz@workstation my_k8s]$ minikube service --all
😿  service default/kubernetes has no node port
😿  service default/redis-leader has no node port
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| NAMESPACE |     NAME     | TARGET PORT  |             URL             |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| default   | hello-node   |         8080 | http://192.168.38.101:31702 |
| default   | kubernetes   | No node port |
| default   | photo-stock  |         8081 | http://192.168.38.101:32225 |
| default   | redis-leader | No node port |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
    </code></pre>
    <p>Ok, we have link to access application's endpoints from gateway. The next step is to set nginx up as a gateway.</p>
    <p>I assume that you already have got ssl certificates for your domain with <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/pages/about">Certbot.</a></p>
    <pre><code class="language-nginx">#/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/gateway.conf

server {
    listen       443 ssl;
    server_name  gaps-apps.ru;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem;

    keepalive_timeout   70;

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }

    error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }

    location /8a38b116132722eef2113a21aef23a19/ {

            proxy_pass http://192.168.38.101:32225/;
    }

}
    </code></pre>
    <p>As we have external url for bot, we can setup telegram api webhook by quering api.telegram.org</p>
<pre><code>#tools/set_webhook.sh

curl -v -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache"
-d '{
"url": "https://gaps-apps.ru/8a38b116132722eef2113a21aef23a19/webhook/"
}'
"https://api.telegram.org/bot{{token}}/setWebhook"

    <h4>Summarizing this</h4>
    <p>This article is experiment itself.</p>
    <p>So don't dare to judge me. :-)</p>
    <p>And don't take it serious.</p>
    <p>I was trying hard to design, implement and describe this proof of concept in one day, but it took almost three.</p>
    <p>Kubernetes still needs to be learned deeper (no wonder). Setting myself to write in english is tricky at first.</p>
    <p>Text demands spellchecking, editing and rewriting, but still первый блин комом.</p>
    <p>Hope you are not bored to death.</p>
    <p>All this project was inspired by my studing of CQRS at the fall of 2021. Separate databases, separate datasources, separate read and writing, you know.</p>
    <p>And now is when deadline comes.</p>

    <p>Stay tuned!</p>
